**getstuffdone.now** is a personalized AI productivity coach that helps users manage tasks and time more effectively. Users can sign up, connect their Google Calendar, and input tasks they want to accomplish. Our AI suggests tailored strategies for each task, adds them to the user's calendar, and adapts over time through user feedback. As users complete tasks and reflect on what worked, the app learns their habits and preferences, continuously improving its recommendations to boost focus, reduce overwhelm, and build sustainable productivity.

*Note: Please contact the contributors if you would like access to our current working .env variables for authentication into Gemini and Google Calendar*
